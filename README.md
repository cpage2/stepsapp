## Description
Project was made as part of the Women Who Code's Front End Friday Challenge.

The design is given through Figma, and participants are allowed to code it in whatever languages they want to use.

The design for this challenge was the home page of a shoe store (Desktop version). Although the design can be done with just html and css, I wanted to practice with react.
